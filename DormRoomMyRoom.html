			<h1> Room: </h1> <h2> My (and my roommate's) Room </h2>
			<p> MY ROOM! shared with another person... My roommate, Lindsay, has one side while I have the other. I am in the back corner with the indentation while she has the side closer to the window. I love art and decorations, so there's a lot of that on my side. Posters, photographs, plants, and millions of other little knickknacks litter my side of the room. </p>
